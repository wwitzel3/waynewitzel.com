<a href="http://www.oopsla.org/oopsla2008/">OOPSLA 2008</a>

The <a href="http://www.sigplan.org/oopsla.htm">Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications</a> or more commonly referred to OOPSLA, annual conference is right around the corner. Oct 19th through the 23rd in Nashville, TN. I am trying to get my company to pay for me to go, but on such short notice, doubt it will happen, even so, I should be able to get paid time off to attend.

This years conference is looking to be a great one. As always they have a ton of workshops and <a href="http://www.oopsla.org/oopsla2008/tutorials.html">tutorials</a> and the keynotes this year look decent. I am particularly interested in the "Building Service-Oriented Architectures with Web Services" and "Test-Driven Hands On" tutorials. Those fall in to my line of work and I am always interested in seeing how others approach the same problems.

As for the <a href="http://www.oopsla.org/oopsla2008/invited-speakers.html">keynotes</a>,Â <a href="http://www.oopsla.org/oopsla2008/invited-speakers.html"></a> <a href="http://www.wirfs-brock.com/">Rebecca's</a> "What Drives Design" and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Jason_Dominus">Mark Dominus'</a> "Atypical Types" both spark my interest.
