title: Moving by blog back!
---
ok, combining personal blog and tech blog was a bad idea. I didn't realize there were some many people following each that were completely uninsterested in the other one. So after some thought, I will be bring back all my Tech posting to <a href="http://pieceofpy.com">pieceofpy.com</a>

My personal stuff will now be on <a href="http://riotousliving.com">Riotous Living</a>! which is a much better platform for all the crazy stuff I do that isn't tech related.

Thanks for putting up with all my shifting and moving around!
