title: I Need a New Theme
---
I want a new theme for my blog. This site runs Wordpress 2.7. So please link your recommendations in the comments. I'd like something simple and clean but a little more pleasing to the eye than this current theme.

I've been flipping through the different ones on the Wordpress site, but there is so many and I have no zero skills when it comes to what looks good and what doesn't; I like Christmas colors if that tells you anything.
