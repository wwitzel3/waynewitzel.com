The traditional first post.

Should it have content? Should it just say welcome to my blog I plan to only update for the next 2 weeks, then try to revive it after a couple months without an update by doing some posting foo and slamming out 10 updates in 1 week. Then after burning myself out in the revival week, I end up closing the blog after 3 more months without an update and try starting another one. We'll see if this one will be any different.
