title: Holidays and New Server
---
I've been a little behind on my posts what with the holidays here and me doing all sorts of traveling and migrating to the new server for pieceofpy.com I haven't really had time to make any new useful posts. So just taking the time to let everyone know I am not dead and wishing everyone happy holidays and a good winter.

Oh and the new server is lovely. The specs are below and so far I couldn't be happier.
<ul>
	<li>3.2GHz P4 Core Duo2</li>
	<li>2GB Memory</li>
	<li>36GB 15k SCSI (Mirrored)</li>
	<li>500GB monthly transfer</li>
</ul>
