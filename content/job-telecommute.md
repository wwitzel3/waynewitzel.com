title: Looking for Work
---
I am looking for telecommute work. With Jessica starting graduate school, which involves a lot of traveling and moving, I won't be able to have an on-site nine to five for the next couple years. I am interested in full-time telecommute and part-time 1099 contract work. If you or someone you know is looking for people, let me know or pass my information along. Here is my <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/wwitzel3">CV</a>.
