title: New Year's Python Meme 2012
---

**1. What's the coolest Python application, framework, or library you have discovered in 2012?**

[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) - This library is a python 2D plotting library that creates great figures that you can use
to provide a visual representation of many data. You can generate plots, histograms, bar charts, etc. The API
for figure creation is very simple and straight forward and I have really enjoyed using it over the last few months.

**2. What new programming technique did you learn in 2012**

The programming I do is a pretty equal mix of brand new code and extensions to existing code. This year I took the time to learn
how to better refactor existing code. That can mean a lot of things to a lot of people, but I specifically focused on refreshing
my knowledge of code smells as defined in *Refactoring - Fowler (1999)* and taking the time to learn how to make better code from
the start by re-reading *Clean Code - Martin (2008)*.

Everytime I re-read books such as these, they almost feel completely new. The years that have passed have given me a completely
different learning expereince from the exact same text.

**3. Which open source project did you contribute to the most in 2012? What did you do?**

[Allura](http://sourceforge.net/p/allura) - To be fair, I work for SourceForge so I get to contribue to Allura as part of my
day job. The contributions range from bug fixes to backend updates to tools and extensions.

[Pyramid](http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/) - This is the project I contributed to the most that
was not part of my day job. That said, the overall level of contributions wasn't that high, just a few bug fixes, minor
JSON renderer update, documentation tweaks, and some Pyramid related blog posts.
You can see them [here](https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/commits?author=wwitzel3).

**4. Which Python blog or website did you read the most in 2012**

Reddit, but to be fair, a lot of the stories I went to on Reddit were because they were linked in the Pycoder's Weekly
newsletter. So maybe Pycoder's Weekly should take the credit.

**5. What are the top things you want to learn in 2013**

In 2013 I hope to continue learning more about mobile development, use AngularJS for something other than a trivial demo, and
continue my general quest to always be a better developer than I am today. I've also been learning a lot of nutrition and other 
health sciences and will probably contintue to focusing on learning more about them in 2013.

**6. What is the top software, application, or library you wish someone would write in 2013**

I think it would be really awesome if there was a recipe application that allowed you to enter in your macronutrient needs for
the day (Protein, Fat, Carbs) and spit out a list of recipes, based on a selected meal frequency, that would make you hit all
of your requirements.

Want to do your own list? here's how:
