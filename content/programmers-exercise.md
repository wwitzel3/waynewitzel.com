title: Exercise even a programmer can do.

So I've been exercising lately. The last visit to the Dr. was a wake up call. 300 lb .. WHAT?! So, taking an iterative approach to exercise, I've manged to work up to 6-day a week cardio routine and a 3-day a week strength training routine and have gone from just over 300 lb. to 270 lb. in a couple months. Couple friends asked how I started and what I do, so I figure I'd break it down here.

I started by walking. 3 times a week for a couple weeks. Then after reading a Lifehacker post about a morning routine and matabolism, I added my very fast morning routine and actually eating breakfast to my day. Made it a whole week Monday-Friday. Then I bumped up the walking to Monday through Saturday. Did the morning routine and the walking for another week, then I bumped up the walking to targeted cardio 3 out of the 6 days and did that for another week. Added strength training 1 out of the 6 days and did that for another week. Switched from walking to cardio on all 6 days and + 1 more week. Then strength training 3 days out of the week. And slowly over about 3 months, I built up to this routine.

<strong>Every morning</strong>
<i>I do this right after eating breakfast</i>
2 sets, push-ups, 30 sec OR failure
2 sets, scissor kicks, 1 minute OR failure

<strong>Monday through Saturday</strong>
2 minute warm up
20 minutes of cardio (140-160 heart rate, check with your Dr.)
2 minute cool down

<strong>Strength training</strong>
<i>This adds another 20 minutes to my workout, so schedule for that</i>
Monday - Push (chest, triceps)
Wednesday - Pull (bicep, shoulders)
Friday - Legs (legs and stomach)

Now, it is just habit. Also, I am sure there is some study somewhere to prove or disprove this, but I find it makes my mind much sharper. I am more alert through out the day and I sleep much better at night. Not to mention clothes fitting better and just feeling better. My personal goal is 250.

<strong>Python tip</strong>
Prefer xrange to range when you need an arbitrary number of iterations as range actually generates a list for you, this will consume memory and be more costly than xrange.
