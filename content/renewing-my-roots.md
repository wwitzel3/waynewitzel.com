title: Renewing my roots.
---
I recently renewed my ACCU and ACM memberships after letting them go for a couple years. I feel like I've done myself a disservice by letting these lapse.

Both of these organizations provided me with countless hours of information and insight as a younger developer and I attribute their journals and usergroups to helping me become the programmer I am today.

These organizations promote growth and learning and both have the goal of making people do what they do better. Easier, smarter, more efficient. I think any programmer who cares about their craft and improving their abilities should seriously look at joining one or both of these organizations.

If you're a past member who has let their subscription lapse it might be time to look in to renewing it, it will pay for itself many times over.
<ul>
	<li> ACM - http://www.acm.org (a Plone site! Yes, seriously)</li>
	<li>ACCU - http://www.accu.org (member count seems thin, but content is still great)</li>
</ul>
Both give you nice print subscriptions to their journals and access to their mailing lists and discussions. ACM membership also affords you access to Books24x7 and Safari.
