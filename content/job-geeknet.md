title: Working for Geeknet
---

I joined <a href="http://geek.net">Geeknet</a> full time this week as a Senior Software Engineer on the <a href="http://sf.net">SourceForge</a> team. I am really looking forward to the challenge ahead and working with everyone on the team. As part of the SourceForge team I will be helping to make SourceForge better for the current users and working on improvements that will attract new projects to SourceForge. My personal goal is to make SourceForge part of the day to day vocabulary like it used to be. I want see SourceForge back in the top three when people ask "Where is a good place to host my code?" or "If you were creating an OSS project, where would you put?". I believe that this team can do that and I am really excited for the future.

I will be candid here, when I first thought of working for Geeknet on the SourceForge team, I was thinking probably the same thing you are ... isn't that only CVS and SVN? That is just for hosting downloads right?

So as part of my initial curiosity of what people currently think of SourceForge versus what is actually happening on the site I did some googling and read up on anything that mentioned SourceForge that was less than 6-months old. I found that it wasn't so much that SourceForge wasn't keeping pace with the other options out there, but that it wasn't marketing the fact that it was keeping pace with the other options out there.

Here are a list of improvements that I didn't know about until I did some research.

 * SourceForge supports Git and Mercurial (and Bazzar).
 * You can fork and submit merge requests with Git and Mercurial.
 * You don't have to get approval for projects.
 * There is a user project space for creating miscellaneous repositories.
 * Integrated Tracker / Commit messages. [#TICKET]
 * 9 out of 10 Ninjas recommend it.
 
When you combine that with one of the best mirror networks out there, live IRC support, and a great community; You get a pretty nice resource. And at a price of FREE.99 (like beer), it was all I needed to know that this was where I wanted to work. Contributing to an long-time open source project that paved the path for other project hosting sites while helping to keep that open spirit alive and well.
