title: 'Allura - Google Summer of Code 2013'
---

[Google Summer of Code](http://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013) is right around the corner. In fact student applications are already open.
The [Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/) has been accepted as one of the mentoring organizations.
This is great news for [Allura](http://incubator.apache.org/allura/) which is part of the ASF Incubator, because we will be eligble to mentor and accept
student proposals for working on Allura.

So if you are intersted in working on a open project hosting platform that is written in Python, I encourage you to register and submit a proposal to the
Apache Software Foundation for working on the Allura project. You can find the tickets that are part of the Allura GSoC 2013 on the
[Apache COMDEV Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?filter=12323652&jql=summary%20~%20Allura%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20gsoc2013).

You can also find useful information about the GSoC on the [ASF GSoC FAQ Page](http://community.apache.org/gsoc.html) and on the [Allura GSoC Wiki page](https://sourceforge.net/p/allura/wiki/Google%20Summer%20of%20Code/).
