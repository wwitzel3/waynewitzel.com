**1. What's the coolest Go application, framework, or library you have discovered in 2014?**

[GeneticGo](https://github.com/handcraftsman/GeneticGo) - This library is a genetic problem solver.
I have had a lot of fun porting some old GAlib code over to it.

**2. What new programming technique did you learn in 2014?**

Since when 2014 started I didn't know any Go at all, I have a pretty long list of Go techniques
that I have learned. I think the most interesting is probably the connurrency and synchronization
patterns that go uses in the form of [channels](https://gobyexample.com/channels).
It has been fun to see the different ways people use channels to express their
thoughts in code.

**3. Which open source project did you contribute to the most in 2014? What did you do?**

[Juju](https://github.com/juju/juju) is the project I contibuted the most to in 2014.
To be fair, I work for Canonical, so I get to contribute to this really cool project
as part of my day job.

My contributions have ranged from improvments and fixes to the logging infrastructure,
fixes for the maas provider, general code refactoring and cleanup, and extending
Juju to help make charming easier.

**4. Which Go blog or website did you read the most in 2014?**

The winner, just like every year I do a programming language meme is [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/).
I know it is most just aggregation, but it is still my portal for all of the Go related content I've read on the
internet in 2014.

**5. What are the top things you want to learn in 2015?**

I would really like to learn more about developing services with Go. Go is batteries
included when it comes to building services and provides great libraries for serving,
marshalling, and communicating data.

I also want to submit at least one patch to Go in 2015.

**6. What is the top software, application, or library you wish someone would write in 2015?**

An application for the phone or tablet that you would train using video to understand how a specific movement
should be performed. Then using the training it would alert you with sound throughout that movement
of when you should proceed to the next part of the movement.

Think about doing a squat. The application would be able to give you a chime when you've satisfied
the eccentric part of the movement and then you could perform the concentric portion of the movement.
Much like in a lifting competition.

Do your own list!
