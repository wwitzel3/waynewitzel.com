title: Moving My Blog
---
I'm moving my blog to <a href="http://waynewitzel.com">http://waynewitzel.com</a>

I have three separate blogs right now and trying to post and maintain them is a big pain in the ass. So I've consolidated all of them in to a self title blog that will range from general posts about life and news to tech posts like you've read here on Piece of Py.

There will be three separate feeds on top of the Everything (<a href="http://waynewitzel.com/category/everything/feed/rss/">http://waynewitzel.com/category/everything/feed/rss/</a>) feed for those who only care about one aspect of the blog.

* Life <a href="http://waynewitzel.com/category/life/feed/rss/">http://waynewitzel.com/category/life/feed/rss/</a>
* Tech <a href="http://waynewitzel.com/category/tech/feed/rss/">http://waynewitzel.com/category/tech/feed/rss/</a>
* Food <a href="http://waynewitzel.com/category/food/feed/rss/">http://waynewitzel.com/category/food/feed/rss/</a>

For Piece of Py subscribers, if you only care about the tech stuff use the Tech Feed.
