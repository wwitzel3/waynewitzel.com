Sometimes I think the only reason I actually keep this blog around is that I can continue to
play with different content systems and migrating between them. That said, I am slowly migrating
all of the existing content for waynewitzel.com over to [Hugo](http://gohugo.io). Hugo is a
static site generator written in Go. It is fast, customizable, and very easy to use.

Unlike previous attempts to migrate, I ensured that all of my content was migrated to the new
site before switching over. I also ensured that I maintained the URL signature for the existing
posts on waynewitzel.com.
