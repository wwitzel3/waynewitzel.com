title: Sucker for the green. Python GUI Green-Bar?
---
I get made fun of on a daily basis for this but I am addicted to GUI Green-Bar testing. When I say that I literally mean a simple little Green/Red progress bar that shows me my pass/fail tests. I am addicted to it. I need it. Eclipse C++ and CUTE had spoiled me and now I desire the same thing for Python. Don't get me wrong, I don't practice "<a href="http://www.adam-bien.com/roller/abien/entry/quality_assurance_driven_development_and">metrics driven development</a>", but for me personally, it is a motivator, an easy and clearly defined goal in my test driven approach, make that bar go full green.

I've spent the last few hours on Google and misc blogs looking for GUI Green bar testing for modern Python and have been unsuccessful in finding anything. So I ask anyone who happens to read this blog if you know of any plugins for any IDEs or text editors that support this for Python.

In the mean time I started my first Eclipse plugin project ever in hopes I can hack my through enough Java and pull enough from PyDev extension that I can make a simple green bar for Eclipse that parses nosetests output or something.
