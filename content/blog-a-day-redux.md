title: Another try at a blog a day?
---
This month is a little calmer for me. No Iceland trip, no Thanksgiving trip, basically no nothing except work and side projects. So I figure I'll have another go at this blog a day thing, minus the 1st and 2nd of this month because I had food poisoning.

November I made it deep in to the first day before my blogging stopped. Hopefully December will be better for me.

Unrelated note, get the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Lion-Andrew-Jackson-White/dp/1400063256">American Lion</a>. Excellent book about Andrew Jackson.
