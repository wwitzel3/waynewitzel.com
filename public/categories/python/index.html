            	This is a story about Pyramid, pyres, some Python 3.3 porting, and just how easy it is to get a task queue working with Pyramid and redis. The story starts with John Anderson convincing me to work on notaliens.com. In the process of developing the Sites portion of the project we decided we wanted to implement a task queue for capturing, storing, and generating the thumbnails of the sites that are submitted to notalienss.

            	Google Summer of Code is right around the corner. In fact student applications are already open. The Apache Software Foundation has been accepted as one of the mentoring organizations. This is great news for Allura which is part of the ASF Incubator, because we will be eligble to mentor and accept student proposals for working on Allura. So if you are intersted in working on a open project hosting platform that is written in Python, I encourage you to register and submit a proposal to the Apache Software Foundation for working on the Allura project.

            	Been reading around and I guess November is the official blog entry a day writers month or something. I&rsquo;ll make a go again. In October, I tried the one post a day run for my blog. I did well, but fell short in the end. Though I&rsquo;ve already missed the first two days in November, I&rsquo;ll call that the margin of error. Oh and I believe the posts should have some meat to them.

            	After Beazley's talk at PyCon &quot;Understanding the Python GIL&quot; I released I had never done any work that released the GIL, spawned threads, did some work, and then restored the GIL. So I wanted to see if I could so something like that with Boost::Python and Boost::Thread and the type of performance I'd get from it with an empty while loop as the baseline. So I hacked up some quick and dirty C++ code and quick bit of runable Python to test out the resulting module and away I went.

            	We wanted to be able to present the user with an input box for their zip and then determine the city state for that zipcode. We don&rsquo;t care about city aliases we just want to get the proper city name. I was given a file from zip-codes.com and told to make it so. This was going to be rather simple and boring. Part of the requirement was to have a tuple returned that contained city, state, short state, and zip code when doing lookups.

            	Note to self, when handling CGI file uploads on a Windows machine, you need the following boiler plate to properly handler binary files. [sourcecode language=&lsquo;python&rsquo;] try: # Windows needs stdio set for binary mode. import msvcrt msvcrt.setmode (0, os.O_BINARY) # stdin = 0 msvcrt.setmode (1, os.O_BINARY) # stdout = 1 except ImportError: pass [/sourcecode] Also, if you&rsquo;re handling very large files and don&rsquo;t want to eat up all your memory saving them using the copyfileobj method, you can use a generator to buffer read and write the file.

            	Okay, I discovered this today when looking to increase the speed at which uploaded documents were saved to disk. Now, I can&rsquo;t explain the inner workings of why it is fast(er), all I know is that with the exact same form upload test ran 100 times with a 25MB file over a 100Mbit/s network this method was on average a whole 2.3 seconds faster over traditional methods of write, writelines, etc..

            	I need to concatenate a set of PDFs, I will take you through my standard issue Python development approach when doing something I&rsquo;ve never done before in Python. My first instinct was to google for pyPDF. Success! So, fore go reading any doc and just give the old easy_install a try. $ sudo easy_install pypdf Another success! Ok, a couple help() calls later and I am ready to go. The end result is surprisingly small and seems to run fast enough even for PDFs with 50+ pages.

In an effort to to be /. safe and Diggable when the new application launches, we&rsquo;ve decided on 4 server deployment. 1 nginx server 2 pylons (paster) servers 1 postgresql server I built nginx from the source without issues. The default install location of /usr/local/nginx works for me. You&rsquo;ll need to make any init scripts and install them, see your platform doucmentation for how to do this.

            	There is an on going discussion at the office with a team member who refuses to use dynamic languages. Claiming that most of his errors are typographical errors and they are caught by the compiler. So for him, since these errors are not caught until runtime, he throws and entire group of languages out the window. He also claims that to ensure that same level of checking with a dynamic language you would have to create more unit tests than normal to prevent introducing unhandled runtime exceptions.

            	So I&rsquo;ve been exercising lately. The last visit to the Dr. was a wake up call. 300 lb .. WHAT?! So, taking an iterative approach to exercise, I&rsquo;ve manged to work up to 6-day a week cardio routine and a 3-day a week strength training routine and have gone from just over 300 lb. to 270 lb. in a couple months. Couple friends asked how I started and what I do, so I figure I&rsquo;d break it down here.

            	In the world of MVC and RESTful services, the old addage fat models, skinny controllers is something I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve constantly seen and read about. So what does it really mean? How do you benefit? Is it the silver bullet for MVC development? What are the draw backs? Using the latest versions of Pylons and SQLalchemy (0.9.7rc2 and 0.5.0rc1 respectivly) we can implement this methodology pretty easily. We&rsquo;ll use formencode schemas to handle the basic input validation and then keep our business logic in the controller itself.

            	I was talking to Tim VanSteenburgh (we both do work for Geek.net) and he had a proof of concept for automatically updating a search index when a change happens to a model and pairing a unified search results page with that to make an easy one-stop search solution for a website. I thought this was a pretty cool idea, so I decided to do a implementation of it on top of the Pyramid framework and share it the readers of my blog.

Download ez_setup.py, python ez_setup.py Download simplejson, python setup.py &ndash;without-speedups install easy_install Pylons easy_install formbuild Do a quick test; paster create &ndash;template=pylons And that is all she wrote.

            	UPDATE / 13 March 2009: snakefight 0.3 now has a &ndash;include-jar option, prefer that to using my hack. After reading P. Jenvey&rsquo;s blog post about Deploying Pylons Apps to Java Servlet Containers I immediately downloaded the Jython 2.5 beta and installed snakefight to give it a try. One of our services where I work is a Pylons based application. It is deployed using paster and Apache ProxyPass. Our main application is written in Java and is deployed as a war under Jetty.

            	I had built my Python interpreter from source because I wanted a 64bit compile to use with boost-python based generic algorithm. So for the last couple months I have not had readline support, which means no arrow support in the console. Also means neat shortcut&rsquo;s like _ would work for assigning the last result of an expression. I finally got annoyed enough today to fix it. After a ton of failed attempts and trying to rebuild it with readline support.

            	1. What&rsquo;s the coolest Python application, framework, or library you have discovered in 2012? matplotlib - This library is a python 2D plotting library that creates great figures that you can use to provide a visual representation of many data. You can generate plots, histograms, bar charts, etc. The API for figure creation is very simple and straight forward and I have really enjoyed using it over the last few months.

            	I play a game called EVE Online and I create and support a lot of software for our in-game corporation. After recently migrating forums away from punBB over to vBulletin I was stuck with the choice to either migrate our existing Ship Insurance script (written in PHP) or create a whole new system from scratch. Being a lover of Python, TDD, and sausage, I of course picked the rewrite option since it would be the most difficult and suck up more resources and time than just migrating some shitty PHP script.

            	So I am playing around in Firefox with XMLHttpRequest. Looking in to a way to facilate a server update to a client without have to refresh the page or use Javascript timers. So the long-live HTTP request seems the way to go. This little app will at most have 20-30 connections at once, so I am not worried about the open connection per client. The data it calculates is rather large and intensive to gather, so I paired it with the cache decorator snippet found on ActiveState and used in Expert Python Programming.

            	When writing web application that expose an API, at some point we end up needing to serialize our custom objects. We create these objects ourselves and other times we are using third-party libraries. Fortunately the latest Pyramid master has new features that allow you to easily define a serialization protocol for custom objects. We provide you with two approaches, the first one will feel familar if you have used TurboGears. The second allows you to handle the serialization of any object, even those third-party ones you didn&rsquo;t write.

            	UPDATE (2011-08-05) Please use caution when reading this post. A lot of the approach and implementation here is flawed. I am keeping the post up for historical purposes, but I am currently working on a follow up post that has a much better and proper implementation of traversal for SQLalchemy models. The practice of not returning real instances as traversal expects and tightly coupling the models to the traversal method is something that is less than desirable and will lead to more pain than gain long term.

            	As I continue to work with Pyramid I find myself really enjoying the web development I am doing. Recently I needed to integrate Google OAuth (and eventually Facebook and Twitter) as part of the options for the user signup experience. I knew Chris Davies has done something similar recently based on some Google+ activity I had read of his, so while I was exploring options, I also spoke with him about his experience with python-openid and velruse.

            	Python 2.6 was release yesterday. I&rsquo;ve had a chance to run most of my code through this latest version and haven&rsquo;t run in to any issues. Looking over the features list I did notice a couple things you might be interested to know. json module added to standard library multiprocessing module was also added with keyword - cleans up some of those try/finally blocks as keyword - more important than people realize print as a method (future imports, standard in 3.0) user defined maps can be used with ** for passing in keyword args All this and more can be found on the What&rsquo;s New in Python 2.6 page.

            	I needed to generate a random IP address for some testing with Google Maps API. Using GeoIP to place a pin when users of a site interact with it. The site is based in the US and will only have US users. I have a list of network ranges from MaxMind in a file. I want to randomly select a network and then randomly select an IP address from that network so the functional testing for the Google Maps and GeoIP integration is a bit more robust.

            	I ran across Sandro Tosi&rsquo;s post about converting a date to epoch and for what ever reason blogger wasn&rsquo;t letting me leave comments so I figured I&rsquo;d toss this post up. I just had to do this very same thing in one of my projects. import time, calendar ts = time.strptime('2010-12-01', '%Y-%m-%d') calendar.timegm(ts) 1291161600 ts = time.strptime('1970-01-01', '%Y-%m-%d') calendar.timegm(ts) 0 So there you have it. Thank you calendar module!

            	Yesterday I found myself writing some very interesting SQLalchemy. The problem is I have a date column in PostgreSQL that is stored as epoch time, so it is just an Interger column. I need to group by year,month and grab the total count of status=&lsquo;A&rsquo; groups for that year,month combination. Here is what I came up with, can you make it cleaner? Faster? I am curious to see the different variations people come up with.

            	I wanted to be able to schedule posts with blogofile and this was the quickest way I could think of to do it. If someone knows of a better way, than please comment cause I would love to read about. My change is pretty simple, if the date in the YAML header is than now, throw a PostProcessing exception and continue on with the next post. I added a cronjob that runs blogofile build every hour, so this solution sucks for blogs that take a long time to build or if you want precision scheduling, but my site builds fast and I am ok with an hour delay.

When I say that I literally mean a simple little Green/Red progress bar that shows me my pass/fail tests. I am addicted to it. I need it. Eclipse C++ and CUTE had spoiled me and now I desire the same thing for Python. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I don&rsquo;t practice &ldquo;metrics driven development&rdquo;, but for me personally, it is a motivator, an easy and clearly defined goal in my test driven approach, make that bar go full green.

            	You see lots of examples on the net for SQLalchemy. Implementing a blog, implementing a wiki, even other articles on implementing tags. Some are good, some are pretty poor, and some are just plain out of date. After some researching on best practices for implementing a Tag system with SQLalchemy I&rsquo;ve come up with the solution you are about to read. I&rsquo;ve pulled these examples from real world production code. Just renamed them and shortened them up a little for the blog post.

            	Today I was working on fetching out some data from an existing PostgreSQL server and generating some BSON output that would later be imported in to MongoDB. One of the problems I ran in to was that I needed to format the timestamps easily for each row of data. Searching the internet I ran across this blog post by Ralph Bean, which does just that, but at a level that was well beyond what I needed.

I thought the obvious solution was to use map with all. Obviously you would replace the lambda call to your own validation method if you had any advanced or complicated checking to do.
