      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I think the only reason I actually keep this blog around is that I can continue to
play with different content systems and migrating between them. That said, I am slowly migrating
all of the existing content for waynewitzel.com over to &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. Hugo is a
static site generator written in Go. It is fast, customizable, and very easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous attempts to migrate, I ensured that all of my content was migrated to the new
site before switching over. I also ensured that I maintained the URL signature for the existing
posts on waynewitzel.com.&lt;/p&gt;
