      <description>&lt;p&gt;I get made fun of on a daily basis for this but I am addicted to GUI Green-Bar testing. When I say that I literally mean a simple little Green/Red progress bar that shows me my pass/fail tests. I am addicted to it. I need it. Eclipse C++ and CUTE had spoiled me and now I desire the same thing for Python. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I don&amp;rsquo;t practice &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.adam-bien.com/roller/abien/entry/quality_assurance_driven_development_and&#34;&gt;metrics driven development&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, but for me personally, it is a motivator, an easy and clearly defined goal in my test driven approach, make that bar go full green.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last few hours on Google and misc blogs looking for GUI Green bar testing for modern Python and have been unsuccessful in finding anything. So I ask anyone who happens to read this blog if you know of any plugins for any IDEs or text editors that support this for Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mean time I started my first Eclipse plugin project ever in hopes I can hack my through enough Java and pull enough from PyDev extension that I can make a simple green bar for Eclipse that parses nosetests output or something.&lt;/p&gt;
