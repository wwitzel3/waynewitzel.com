      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am looking for telecommute work. With Jessica starting graduate school, which involves a lot of traveling and moving, I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to have an on-site nine to five for the next couple years. I am interested in full-time telecommute and part-time 1099 contract work. If you or someone you know is looking for people, let me know or pass my information along. Here is my &lt;a href=&#34;http://careers.stackoverflow.com/wwitzel3&#34;&gt;CV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
