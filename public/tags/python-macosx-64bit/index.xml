      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had built my Python interpreter from source because I wanted a 64bit compile to use with boost-python based generic algorithm. So for the last couple months I have not had readline support, which means no arrow support in the console. Also means neat shortcut&amp;rsquo;s like _ would work for assigning the last result of an expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally got annoyed enough today to fix it. After a ton of failed attempts and trying to rebuild it with readline support. I found a post in the Ruby world where someone has having similar issues. Their solution was rlwrap. Having homebrew installed, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d give that a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
wwitzel:~ brew install rlwrap
wwitzel:~ alias python=&amp;lsquo;rlwrap python&amp;rsquo;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And presto, everything functioned as it should. I added the alias to my .bash_profile and made this blog post for when I forget about this in the future. Hope this helps someone else who might be wrestling with the same issue.&lt;/p&gt;
